# Use something like the following line, substituting the VID and PID with
# those of your device. ATTRS{busnum}=="001" is USB - if none = all USB bus
# ATTRS{idProduct}=="5757" - if none = all PID

# HIDAPI/hidraw
KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5757", MODE="0666"

# Once done, optionally rename this file for your device, and drop it into
# /etc/udev/rules.d and unplug and re-plug your device. This is all that is
# necessary to see the new permissions. Udev does not have to be restarted.

# Note that the hexadecimal values for VID and PID are case sensitive and
# must be lower case.

# If you think permissions of 0666 are too loose, then see:
# http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html for more information on finer
# grained permission setting. For example, it might be sufficient to just
# set the group or user owner for specific devices (for example the plugdev
# group on some systems).
